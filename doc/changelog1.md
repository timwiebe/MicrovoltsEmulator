# 2.1 Changelog from version 1.0 to version 2.0

A lot of things changed and the list is simply too big to fit in a page. I will try to focus on the most important aspects to give an idea how much work was put in the last year (thanks to the community who helped testing too, of course!)

## 2.1.1 Complete code refactoring
One of the main goals of version 2.0 was to clean up the entire codebase — that includes the Main Server, Cast Server, Auth Server, and the Common library.

The code from version 1.0 worked, but it had a lot of problems when it came to maintainability and readability. It was messy in some places, hard to follow, and had some tricky lifetime issues, especially with how ASIO was used. It just wasn’t easy to work with, especially for anyone new coming into the project.

### Cross Platform
Finally, the project is starting to work on other platforms too!
Currently, the project has been tested with Windows (MSVC) and Linux (GCC). 

### Code Organization & Readability
Version 2.0 changes all that. Things are now much more organized, and the code is way easier to read. If you’re opening the project for the first time, it should be a lot more approachable now.

In 1.0, the logic was often all over the place and pretty hard to understand without spending a lot of time digging. With this new version, I tried to make everything feel more structured and easier to follow, so it’s not just me who can work on this — but anyone who’s interested.

### Networking performance
Version 2.0 offers better networking performance with ASIO. Also, most of the server handlers & session management was rewritten with optimization in mind. Many data strucutres were changed:
- used the stack where possibly instead of allocating memory.
- flattened multiple arrays.
- Made the logic much better server side for quicker code execution.

### Security improvements & server stability
The new version also had security improvements in mind.
- Multiple exploits prevention are now available in this version: prevented various exploits such as room crashes, duplicate items, items disappearing, etc.
- Anti-SYS flooding system: there were issues with SYS flooding in the ToyBattles project. I thus decided to add a simple anti SYS flooding system.
- No more constant server crashes: a lot of issues related to bad memory management were fixed. The servers in version 2.0 are now much, much more stable and with less crashes than ever!
- Added 2FA authentication for graded accounts (mandatory), and for normal accounts (if wanted).
  
### Bug fixes
Almost all bugs that existed in version 1.0 were fixed:
- Automatic host change bugs that crashed the server or the room were solved,
- Multiple bugs related items disappearing were fixed,
- Multiple inventory-related bugs were fixed,
- Trade system bugs were fixed.
- Match related bugs were mostly fixed.
- Infinite match loading is now fixed.
- The mail notifications now disappear after retrieving a gift.
- In-game messages are now handled properly.
- The "2 nades/bazooka simultaneously" bug is now fixed.
- The lucky meter free spin in the capsule that caused client crashes before is fixed.
- Single wave end screen is now working properly.
- Room settings are now always updated correctly.
- Host suicide in-match now works properly.
- No more ping related issues inside matches.
- Death chat now works correctly.
- Fixed various room join player-duplication bugs.
 ...and much more!

## 2.1.2 New Features
I also added a lot of new features in version 2.0!
- Arena Mode: this is a mode inspired by ToyHeroes, but fully server sided in this project. To enable it, all you need is to be in a room with the "Academy Training Ground" map. You can find examples of Arena Mode on youtube.
- Assassin Mode: this is a completely new, server-sided mode. It works on Elimination and can be activated while you're the host in a room by using the chat command `/setassassinmode`. Make sure to try it out!
- Gift System was now added. Game masters can use the `/sendgift` command to send items to players.
- New in-game commands for Event Supporters, Moderators and Game Masters: these can be all found inside MainServer/ChatCommands.
- Improved the Trade System.
- Clan wars finally work!
- Event missions were introduced. These must be enabled inside the main server (MainServer/include/handlers/HandleEliminationNextRound.h) and by modifying the `cdb.dip` archive.
- Level up rewards are now available.
- Level up now works correctly.
- Clan icons are now displayed correctly in all rooms.
- In-game battery is now given correctly.
- Multiple items addition: instant respawn for matches, boxes, battery boxes, super glues, etc.
- Inventory enhancements: weapon upgrades, items for upgrading etc. now work correctly without a relog.
- Tutorial and single wave now gives reward boxes as originally.
- It is now possible to votekick during a match.
- Random map selection now works properly.
- Added weekly & monthly rewards. 
- Multiple servers across different VPS are now handled correctly and you can set them up easily.
- Added a `config.ini` file to keep track of the setup and all the servers.
- Coupons and coupon shop now work properly.
- The main server can now handle requests from your admin panel (a website). You can now send commands to the main server externally!
- Achievements were implemented and are now stored in the database.
- Added capsule sale events, event missions start and end dates inside the database. The trade system can now be enabled by date as well.
 ...and so much more!

## Miscellaneous
### 2.1.3 Database Changes
Back in version 1.0, the emulator relied on SQLite — which worked, but wasn’t really ideal for a more serious setup. With version 2.0, everything has been moved over to MariaDB, which is a big step up in terms of flexibility and reliability.

This switch meant a full refactor of how database operations are handled. The cool part? Now you can have multiple servers (Auth, Main, Cast, etc.) all sharing the same database — something that wasn’t really possible or safe before.

### 2.1.4 Client Updater
Another big change: the client updater is now open source. That means you can use it to make sure every player is running the latest version of your client. It gives you full control over pushing updates, whether it’s bug fixes, new content, or any other change you want players to have before they launch the game.

### 2.1.5 External Admin Panel Support
Version 2.0 also introduces support for external admin panels. In other words, the Main Server now has an API that allows communication with a website or web-based admin interface.

Everything is protected with proper authentication — including user grades and JWT tokens — so only authorized users can access it. Through this system, you can do things like kick, ban, or mute players directly from your panel, without needing to log into the server manually. It’s all covered in the “Website API” chapter coming up.
